Convenience script to
Retrieve assets (cards, mutators, clans, heroes) ids from the "constants" files

- Leaderboard API responses return lot of ids (for cards, mutators, relics...)
- Modding community already parsed the assets.
- See. https://github.com/brandonandzeus/Trainworks2
- Specifically in /ConstantsV2 folder : .cs files that we will parse into a single file.
- We already downloaded the .cs files in utils/ (cf. dl_constants.py)
